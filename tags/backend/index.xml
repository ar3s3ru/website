Most notably, I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the development of eventually-rs, a Rust crate providing support for Event-sourced applications.
My background has to do with Systems Programming and Backend Development, which was the main drive for creating eventually.
In the process of writing the crate, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reimplementing a couple of those microservices I was currently working on on my daily job, as a sort of testing project to validate the soundness of the crate and its design decisions.</description></item></channel></rss>
