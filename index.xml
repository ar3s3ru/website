Most notably, I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the development of eventually-rs, a Rust crate providing support for Event-sourced applications.
My background has to do with Systems Programming and Backend Development, which was the main drive for creating eventually.
In the process of writing the crate, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reimplementing a couple of those microservices I was currently working on on my daily job, as a sort of testing project to validate the soundness of the crate and its design decisions.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://ar3s3ru.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ar3s3ru.dev/about/</guid><description>Ciao, my name is Dani!
I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer from Italy, currently living in Berlin and working for HelloFresh SE.
I mostly work with PHP nowadays, but me and Go &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; way back :lol: [EDIT: actually, that&amp;rsquo;s not true anymore; I&amp;rsquo;m mostly using Go, Kotlin and some Rust these days, but I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this one up &amp;lsquo;cause I like the joke hehe]
My current interests are:
Domain modeling and Domain-driven Design Event Sourcing Rust Kotlin Functional programming Wanna talk about some of them?</description></item></channel></rss>
